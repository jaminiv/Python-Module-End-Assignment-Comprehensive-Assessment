Project Overview: Employee Data Analysis This project explores a dataset containing employee information (replace with details about your data source). The analysis aims to uncover insights into team composition, employee demographics, and salary distribution.

Preprocessing Steps:

Data loading: The employee data is loaded from a CSV file (or other data source) into a pandas DataFrame for analysis. Data cleaning: Data inconsistencies or errors are rectified to ensure data quality for analysis. Analysis Tasks:

Team Distribution: The code calculates the number of employees within each team and presents the distribution as a table with a new 'Percentage' column, indicating the proportion of employees in each team relative to the total workforce.

Employee Segregation by Position: The code analyzes the data to identify the distribution of employees across different positions within the company. A pie chart is generated to visually represent this distribution.

Predominant Age Group: The code investigates the age data to determine the age group with the most employees. A bar chart is created to visualize the distribution of employees across age groups, highlighting the predominant group.

Highest Salary Expenditure: The code identifies the team and position combination that has the highest total salary expenditure. Two visualization options are provided:

A basic bar chart displaying a single bar representing the highest expenditure team-position.

Insights Gained:

The analysis provides insights into the team structure of the organization, revealing the size and composition of each team. It helps identify the most common employee positions and visualize the distribution of employees across different roles. By analyzing age data, the project provides information about the predominant age group within the workforce. It's crucial to understand salary expenditure patterns across teams and positions to optimize resource allocation and identify potential salary outliers.
